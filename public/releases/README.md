## Release Notes

Release notes can be added to this folder. They will automatically be shown to the consultant user if the version of the application matches the filename.
The filename needs to be prepended by an "v" and must be a valid markdown file.

For this theming repository the version is the npm package referenced from the caritas open source repository.

For example:
`v.v0.0.0-npmPackage.v.062-obi-20.md`
if the referenced npmPackage is
`0.0.0-npmPackage.v.062-obi-20`
